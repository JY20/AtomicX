# AtomicX Cross-Chain Swap Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Exchange Rate Calculation Error
**Problem**: The "You Receive" amount was showing incorrect values due to duplicate useEffect hooks
- **Before**: 0.01 ETH → 0.01 STRK (wrong!)
- **After**: 0.01 ETH → 2,600 STRK (correct market rate)

**Solution**: Removed conflicting useEffect that was overriding the market rate calculation

### 2. ✅ Button Disabled Issue  
**Problem**: "Create Cross-Chain Swap" button was disabled even with sufficient balance
- **Before**: Required 0.01 ETH + 0.001 ETH gas = 0.011 ETH (user had 0.0109 ETH)
- **After**: Required 0.01 ETH + 0.0005 ETH gas = 0.0105 ETH (now enabled!)

**Solution**: 
- Reduced gas estimate from 0.001 ETH to 0.0005 ETH (more realistic)
- Added helpful button text showing exact requirements when disabled

### 3. ✅ Improved User Experience
**Button States**:
- `Connect ETH Wallet` - when Ethereum wallet not connected
- `Connect Starknet Wallet` - when Starknet wallet not connected  
- `Enter Amount` - when no amount entered
- `Need X.XXXX ETH (amount + gas)` - when insufficient balance
- `Create Cross-Chain Swap` - when ready to execute

## Current Exchange Rate
- **Rate**: 1 ETH = 260,000 STRK  
- **Example**: 0.1 ETH = 26,000 STRK
- **Formatted**: Large numbers display with commas (e.g., "26,000 STRK")

## Gas Requirements
- **Estimate**: 0.0005 ETH per transaction
- **Total Required**: Swap Amount + 0.0005 ETH
- **Example**: To swap 0.01 ETH, you need 0.0105 ETH total

## Technical Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **`SwapPage.js`**:
   - Removed duplicate useEffect causing calculation conflicts
   - Enhanced button with detailed state messages
   - Updated gas estimates in error messages

2. **`WalletContext.js`**:
   - Reduced gas estimate from 0.001 to 0.0005 ETH
   - Added null checks in balance validation
   - Updated error messages with new gas amounts

3. **`SwapPage.css`**:
   - Ensured text colors are black for readability
   - Added proper color inheritance rules

## Testing

### How to Test the Fixes:
1. **Amount Calculation**:
   - Enter "0.01" ETH
   - Should show "2,600" STRK (not "0.01" STRK)

2. **Button Enablement**:
   - With 0.0109 ETH balance and 0.01 ETH swap amount
   - Button should now be enabled (was disabled before)

3. **Error Messages**:
   - Try swapping more than balance
   - Should show helpful message with exact requirements

## Next Steps
- Test with live wallets on testnets
- Monitor gas usage to verify 0.0005 ETH estimate
- Consider implementing dynamic gas estimation
